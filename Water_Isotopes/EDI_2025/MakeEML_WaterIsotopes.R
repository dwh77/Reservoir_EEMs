# (install and) Load EMLassemblyline #####
# install.packages('devtools')

# devtools::install_github("EDIorg/EDIutils")
# devtools::install_github("EDIorg/taxonomyCleanr")
# devtools::install_github("EDIorg/EMLassemblyline")

#note that EMLassemblyline has an absurd number of dependencies and you
#may exceed your API rate limit; if this happens, you will have to wait an
#hour and try again or get a personal authentification token (?? I think)
#for github which allows you to submit more than 60 API requests in an hour
library(EMLassemblyline)


## Step 17: Obtain a package.id FROM STAGING ENVIRONMENT. ####
# Go to the EDI staging environment (https://portal-s.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp),
# then login using one of the Carey Lab usernames and passwords. 

# Select Tools --> Data Package Identifier Reservations and click 
# "Reserve Next Available Identifier"
# A new value will appear in the "Current data package identifier reservations" 
# table (e.g., edi.123)
# Make note of this value, as it will be your package.id below

## Step XXX: Make EML metadata file using the EMLassemblyline::make_eml() command ####
# For modules that contain only zip folders, modify and run the following 
# ** double-check that all files are closed before running this command! **

make_eml(
  path = "./Water_Isotopes/EDI_2025",
  data.path = "./Water_Isotopes/EDI_2025",
  eml.path = "./Water_Isotopes/EDI_2025",
  dataset.title = "Time series of stable water isotopes (d18O, d2H) from Carvins Cove Reservoir in Southwestern Virginia, USA 2024-2025",
  temporal.coverage = c("2024-05-22", "2025-04-16"),
  maintenance.description = 'completed',
  data.table = c("WaterIsotopes_CCR_2024_2025.csv",
                 "WaterIsotopes_CCR_precip_2024.csv",
                 "site_descriptions.csv"),
  data.table.description = c("Tributary and reservoir stable water isotope samples",
                             "Precipitation stable water isotope samples",
                             "Description, latitude, and longitude of reservoir sampling sites"),
  other.entity= c('WaterIsotopes_CCR_inspection_2024_2025.Rmd'),
  other.entity.description = c("Data visualization script"
                               ),
  user.id = 'ccarey',
  user.domain = 'EDI',
  package.id = 'edi.1776.3')

## Step 8: Check your data product! ####
# Return to the EDI staging environment (https://portal-s.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp),
# then login using one of the Carey Lab usernames and passwords. 

# Select Tools --> Evaluate/Upload Data Packages, then under "EML Metadata File", 
# choose your metadata (.xml) file (e.g., edi.270.1.xml), check "I want to 
# manually upload the data by selecting files on my local system", then click Upload.

# Now, Choose File for each file within the data package (e.g., each zip folder), 
# then click Upload. Files will upload and your EML metadata will be checked 
# for errors. If there are no errors, your data product is now published! 
# If there were errors, click the link to see what they were, then fix errors 
# in the xml file. 
# Note that each revision results in the xml file increasing one value 
# (e.g., edi.270.1, edi.270.2, etc). Re-upload your fixed files to complete the 
# evaluation check again, until you receive a message with no errors.

## Step 17: Obtain a package.id. ####
# 



## Step 18: Upload revision to EDI
# Go to EDI website: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp and login with Carey Lab ID
# Click: Tools then Evaluate/Upload Data Packages
# Under EML Metadata File, select 'Choose File'
# Select the .xml file of the last revision (i.e., edi.202.4)
# Under Data Upload Options, select 'I want to manually upload the data by selecting...'
# Click 'Upload'
# Select text files and R file associated with the upload
# Then click 'Upload': if everything works, there will be no errors and the dataset will be uploaded!
# Check to make sure everything looks okay on EDI Website
